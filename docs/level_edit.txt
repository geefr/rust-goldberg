- Run main target, provide the level name as first argument
- If no name provided will use 'default'
- When level saved will be output to assets/levels/<name>.json
- To reload level pass the nam on command line again

Note:
- If you save any old changes are gone
- Entities are saved in their spawn positions, before they're knocked over or have any forces applied
-> So don't save after throwing a bunch of objects around the scene, it won't work out how you think
