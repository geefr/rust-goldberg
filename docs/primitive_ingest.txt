Primitive ingest process
- Build primitive in blender
- Ensure that primitive's base is at 0 height
- Ensure primitive is centered at 0.0,0.0 horizontally

Export to OBJ
- triangulate faces
- Save to models/primitives
- Z forward, y up
- For materials set material type to specular, click 'use nodes', then setup material. If you don't it'll just export grey :|

Create primitive definition
- cargo run --release --bin define-primitive
- Answer ze questions Mr Bond >:|
-> Collider center should be the center of the object
-> Collider dimensions should be 1/2 x/y/z size of object
-> Collider should be specified as per the original model - Primitive scale will be applied automatically in engine
-> Don't forget that y/z are swapped between blender and engine
- Save json it spits out to assets/primitives/xxxx.json
